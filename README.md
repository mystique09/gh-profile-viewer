# Github profile viewer made with Elm.

I did this out of boredom and also because I wanted to learn FP programming.

TODO(s):
- [x] Initial structure.
- [x] Get user based on input.
- [x] Http request to github API.
- [ ] Separate the viewUser component to another file.
- [ ] Nice styling.
- [ ] Timeout every input to avoid ratelimmit.
